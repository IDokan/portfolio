							<p>In Sophomore project, I was Graphics Programmer in five person team that made "Cheese Roll" with custom game engine.</p>

							<p>This project is the most precious experience in the Sophomore year becuase it gave me a deeper understanding of OpenGL and C++.</p>
							<p>I mainly implemented graphics interfaces to make other programmers draw image conveniently inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Thought-Process-Developers-Library/dp/0135181968/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=580635443439&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9060587&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16875356410863721259&hvtargid=kwd-1285673912&hydadcr=22596_13493364&keywords=the+object+oriented+thought+process&qid=1684470958&sr=8-1">The Object-Oriented Thought Process</a>. Not only Graphics code, I also contributed on game's main mechanisms such as string between player, Camera movement, and Save point which is represented as refrigerator. Moreover, I implemented loading effect (we called melting cheese transition) and UI/UX in the game. Lastly, I was able to learn and apply a bunch of game programming pattern such as Message, and State design patterns.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>In perspective of team management, it was the first project I and all of my teammates used <a href="https://github.com/IDokan/GAM200Engine">Git</a> properly. I managed and resolved all of merges and conflicts that happened during projects. Furthermore, I forced my teammates to must do 'Check in Buddy'(shortly we called it CIB) and make sure write detailed commit description.</p> 
							<span class="image right"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/GitKraken.PNG" alt="" style="float:right;"/></span>
							<p>CIB (Check-In Buddy) was a valuable practice for sharing my progress and bug resolutions with teammates. By providing updates on what I had accomplished and how I resolved any bugs, I could review my own work and also learn about the progress of others. This process often yielded unexpected results and insights. Additionally, CIB proved to be beneficial in situations where a teammate was unable to complete their work due to illness or emergencies. In such cases, a buddy who was familiar with their tasks could step in and ensure the work was completed. This experience highlighted the effectiveness of CIB as a risk management method within our team.</p>

							<span class="image left"><image src="images/SophomoreProjects/commitDescription.png" /></span>
							
							<p>The other thing I forced is writing detailed commit description. I did not let teammates ignore commit description section. Sometimes we were under circumstances which we could not CIB. In the circumstance, others could know what I did. Not only this purpose, documenting my achievements is totally valid to do this.</p>
							<div style="clear:both"></div>
							<p>Finally, I would mention is team coding standards (breif version is <a href="images/SophomoreProjects/coding standards.txt">here</a>). I and my teammates discussed and made this standards to unity everyone's coding style. Furthermore, when a new teammate joined, we easily taught team's coding standard without using human resource.</p>
